# In The Loop - Crochet Project Tracker

My app is designed for crocheters to track their projects. Most crocheters will have multiple "WIPs" (Works in Progress) at a time, it can get boring working on the same project for too long. I'm notorious for this and lose track of all the projects I have in progress so I will definitely utilise my own app.

In this app, you can also see a Live Feed of all the other projects that other crocheters have on the go. This makes it a great place to source inspiration for your next project and share you completed or ongoing projects.
