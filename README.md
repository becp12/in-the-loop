# In The Loop - Crochet Project Tracker

My app is designed for crocheters to track their projects. Most crocheters will have multiple "WIPs" (Works in Progress) at a time, it can get boring working on the same project for too long. I'm notorious for this and lose track of all the projects I have in progress so I will definitely utilise my own app.

In this app, you can also see a Live Feed of all the other projects that other crocheters have on the go. This makes it a great place to source inspiration for your next project and share you completed or ongoing projects.

## Screenshots

My Projects Page - Can only see projects you have posted yourself and are the only one who can edit/delete your projects

New Project Page - The Update Project page looks very similar but data is prefilled with information already saved in the project

Show Project View - The update and delete buttons are only visible to the creator of the project
